    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">First of all I would confirm and check that their SSL-certificate is up to date and active. HTTPS is the most important part of web security these days. I would also advise them to implement defenses against XSS. With secure policies for CORS and HSTS, I believe we would be fine. 2FA would be advised if they had some type of login on their site/backend.</p>
